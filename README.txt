Hao Gia - Website (HTML + React)

Files included:
- index.html  (lightweight single-page HTML version)
- HaoGiaWebsite.jsx  (single-file React component for use in a React app)
- assets/logo.png  (your logo or placeholder)

How to use:

Option A - Quick: open index.html locally
1. Unzip the package, open index.html in a browser. Edit the contact placeholders in the file if needed.

Option B - Deploy to Vercel (recommended)
1. Create a free Vercel account at https://vercel.com.
2. Click 'New Project' -> 'Import' -> 'Upload' and select the unzipped folder or the .zip file.
3. Vercel will detect a static site and deploy. After a few seconds you'll get a URL like https://haogia-username.vercel.app

Option C - Use the React component
1. Create a React app (npx create-react-app my-app)
2. Replace src/App.jsx with HaoGiaWebsite.jsx (or import the component)
3. Put assets/logo.png into public/ or import it correctly
4. npm run build && deploy to Vercel or Netlify

Placeholders:
- Contact email and Zalo are placeholders (your@email.com, https://zalo.me/your-number). Replace them in index.html or in the React component.

If you want, I can:
- Create the .zip and provide a download link (done here)
- Deploy it to Vercel for you (I can guide step-by-step)
- Replace the placeholders with your real contact info

Enjoy!
