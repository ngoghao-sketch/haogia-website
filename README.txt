Hao Gia - Website with simple Admin

Files included:
- index.html  (site)  - title set to 'Hao Gia'
- admin.html  (admin UI protected by password 'haogia0625')
- assets/logo.png  (your logo)
- assets/gallery/  (empty folder for gallery images)

How the admin works:
1. Open admin.html in your browser (or visit https://<your-site>/admin.html after deploy).
2. Enter password: haogia0625
3. Click 'Choose images' and select images from your computer.
4. Preview images will show. Click 'Download ZIP' to get a ZIP containing selected images.
5. On GitHub: open your repo > go to 'assets/gallery/' > upload the images (or upload the ZIP contents).
6. Commit changes. Vercel will redeploy automatically and gallery images will appear on the site.

Notes:
- The admin UI is client-side only: it helps you assemble images and create a ZIP to upload to GitHub.
- For a full CMS that commits directly to GitHub, a more advanced setup (OAuth + serverless functions) is needed.

If you want, I can also:
- Upload the images into your GitHub repo for you (you'd need to add me as a collaborator or provide access token),
  or I can give step-by-step instructions with screenshots to upload files via GitHub web UI.

Enjoy!
